###Assignment 1:

This app is designed by PHP in Laravel which is about movie comment.
People can add/delete/modify/search/like/dislkie comments here. So that they can know which movie is a good movie.
In this app, I added search and authentication functions.

###Assignment 2 Update:

In this assignment, I added more functions to the MovieComment and fixed some bugs of old functions:

* Fixed some details of the Front-End User Interface.

* Fixed search function: score must === the value rather than 'like' the value.

* Added reset password function by sending email to users.

* Made relationships between different tables.

* Added a function which could show who updated the comment recently.

* Added verify code(which is drew by PHP on back-end) to the login page.

* Added Third-party login function adapted Github and Weibo.

* Added a User detail page, which allows user see and change their own information and comment, and reset password.
